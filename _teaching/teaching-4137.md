This course covers core micro-econometric methods and the principles of causal inference. The course starts with a review of ordinary least squares and two-stage least squares regressions and specification issues from ECON4150. Building on the potential outcomes framework, we will discuss the interpretation of these estimators in case of heterogeneous treatment effects. We further cover regression discontinuity designs, basic panel data, difference-in-differences, maximum likelihood estimation and binary and multinomial choice models.
