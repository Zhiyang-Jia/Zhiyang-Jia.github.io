I am a Senior Researcher (Forsker 0) in the Research Department at Statistics Norway.

My main research interests lie in applied econometrics, focusing on labor economics and public economics. A key aspect of my work is addressing important policy questions regarding behavioral responses in the labor market to changes in economic incentives, such as social security rules and tax policies. My contributions to labor supply analysis include developing a structural empirical framework for labor supply under constraints and applying it to evaluate social policies. Additionally, I have used quasi-experimental methods to evaluate the effects of public policies and gain insights into underlying mechanisms by leveraging policy changes.

I have also explored topics such as workers' capacity to work from home, measuring the utility of income, analyzing parametric income distributions, and household decision-making. Moreover, I am interested in developing microsimulation models that facilitate public policy-making, including models for tax policies (LOTTE_Skatt and LOTTE_Arbeid), regional population projections, and projection models for health sector workforce supply and demand (Helsemod).

I have also taught applied econometrics at both the master's and PhD levels at the Department of Economics, University of Oslo.
